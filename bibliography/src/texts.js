        "textProvided": "<p>[FRENCH 11-12] J’ai été prié d’écrire quelques mots pour présenter ce livre aux lecteurs français, qui peu¬vent, à première vue, trouver quelque ambiguïté dans ma position. Qui est, se demande-t-on, ce laïc anglican, traduit et présenté par des catholiques, et qui unit sur la page de garde des Screwtape Let¬ters une citation de Sir Thomas More à un texte de Martin Luther ? Ignore-t-il les différences entre chrétiens ou les estime-t-il sans importance ? En aucune façon. Comme chrétien, je suis très conscient que nos divisions attristent le Saint-Esprit et retardent l’œuvre du Christ ; comme logicien, je reconnais que là où deux Eglises énoncent des affirmations qui s’oppo¬sent, ces affir¬ma¬tions ne peuvent être conciliées. Mais comme je fus longtemps incroyant, je me suis rendu compte d’une chose que peut-être les fidèles de naissance ne voient pas. Quand je craignais et détestais le chris¬ti¬a¬nisme, la grande unité, qu’en dépit de ses divi¬sions il ne cessait de détenir, me frappa. Je reconnus, et je tremblai à cette reconnaissance, le même arôme irrécusable, qui me parvenait à travers l’œuvre de Dante ou celle de Bunyan, celle de Thomas d’Aquin ou de William Law. Depuis ma conversion, il m’a semblé que c’était ma tâche particulière d’apprendre au monde extérieur ce que croient tous les chrétiens. Je laisse à d’autres les contro¬verses ; c’est une matière qui regarde les théologiens avertis. Je crois que vous et moi, le laïcat, les simples soldats de la foi, servirons mieux de manière habituelle la cause de la ré¬con¬ciliation, non en apportant notre con¬tribution à de tels débats, mais par nos prières et par le partage en commun de tout ce qui peut être partagé de la vie chrétienne dès maintenant. Si l’unité de charité et d’intention était assez puis-sante entre nous, peut-être les dif-fé-rences doc¬trinales en seraient-elles plus tôt résolues ; et sans cette unité spiri¬tuelle, un accord doctrinal entre nos chefs religieux serait stérile.Entre-temps, il apparaîtra que celui qui est le plus fidèle à vivre la vie chrétienne dans sa propre confes¬sion, est spirituellement le plus proche de ceux qui ne relèvent pas de la même obédience ; car la géographie du monde spirituel est très différente de celle du monde physique. En ce dernier les pays se touchent par leurs frontières, dans le premier ils se touchent par leur cen¬tre. C’est le tiède et l’indifférent dans chaque région qui sont les plus éloignés de toute autre contrée.</p> <p>[TRANSLATION 296-97] I was asked to write a few words of introduction to this book for French readers, who might at first find something ambiguous in my position. Who, one might ask, is this Angli¬can layman, translated and introduced by Catholics, who, on the frontispiece of The Screwtape Letters, brings together a quotation from Sir Thomas More and one from Martin Luther? Is he unaware of the differences between Christians, or does he consider them unimportant? By no means. As a Christ¬ian, I am very much aware that our divisions grieve the Holy Spirit and hold back the work of Christ; as a logician I realize that when two churches affirm opposing positions, these cannot be reconciled. But because I was an unbeliever for a long time, I perceived something which perhaps those brought up in the Church do not see. Even when I feared and detested Christianity, I was struck by its essential unity, which, in spite of its divisions, it has never lost. I trembled on recognizing the same unmistakable aroma coming from the writings of Dante and Bunyan, Thomas Aquinas and William Law. Since my conversion, it has seemed my particular task to tell the outside world what all Chris¬tians believe. Controversy I leave to others: that is the business of theologians. I think that you and I, the laity, simple soldiers of the Faith, will best serve the cause of reconciliation not so much by contributing to such debates, but by our prayers, and by sharing all that can already be shared of Christian life. If the unity of charity and intention between us were strong enough, perhaps our doctrinal dif¬ferences would be resolved sooner; without that spiritual unity, a doctrinal agreement between our religious leaders would be sterile. In the meantime, it will be apparent that the man who is most faithful in living the Christian life in his own church is spiritually the closest to the faithful believers in other confessions: be¬cause the geography of the spiritual world is very different from that of the physical world. In the latter, countries touch each other at their borders, in the former, at their centre. It is the lukewarm and indifferent in each country who are furthest from all other countries.</p> <p>[FRENCH 163 NOTE] Actuellement, je considère la conception de l’Incarnation impliquée dans ce paragraphe, comme grossière et due à l’ignorance.</p> <p>[TRANSLATION 296] I now consider the conception of the Incarnation implied in this paragraph as gross and the result of ignorance.</p>",

He was not, of course, a humorist of the heart like Dickens or our own patron: the mingled humour and pathos of the scene in Huckleberry Finn where Huck tries to betray Jim and decides that he is a reprobate because he can’t, would have been outside his powers. He was a humorist of the more intellectual kind, a master of satire, art and fantasy like Gilbert, Wilde and Aristophanes. In that class no one had more continuous vitality. He is also, in his prefaces, one of the great masters of plain prose. I have often, in that capacity, held him up as a model to my pupils and have learned much from him myself. Peace to his ashes!

He said that he did not know why he had been asked to address the people of Iceland, but that he agreed to do it in order to repay a great debt. He explained that his imaginative life had been awakened by Norse mythology when he was 14. He went on to explain how his love of Norse mythology only deepened when he began to learn the Icelandic language at Oxford.", "After this introduction, Lewis proceeded to praise the Icelandic tongue as one of the most poetic on earth. Rather than a private view of his own, Lewis argued that successive generations of English writers have felt this affinity with the old Norse tales and that this influence has found its way into the greatest of English literature. He cited Sir William Temple, William Morris, Charles Dickens, Shakespeare, Fielding, and Thomas Grey as examples of what he meant. The literature of England, inspired by the Norse, views self-important office holders as knaves and fools. By implication, the English had come to Iceland to repay a great debt and help fend off the knave and fool who ran Germany.", "Behind the literature itself, Lewis focused on a prevailing spirit found in those Norse explorers who refused to be part of a mere medieval kingdom. Instead, Lewis argued that the English and the Norse share a spirit of independence which finds its origins in the Norse settlers of Iceland and animates English literature.", "Lewis claimed that this common spirit is different from what one finds in Europe. He did not want to identify it as democracy, because this spirit rejects the interference of democracy as much as dictatorshiNor does he regard it as a revolutionary spirit or individualism. This spirit is often marked by great loyalty that individualism does not possess. This loyalty, however, is based on choice rooted in worthy values—a chief who deserves loyalty. Just when it seems that Lewis had succeeded in avoiding jargon altogether, he names this spirit personal realism! Fortunately, he explained that personal realism involves loyalty between two people that is not based on abstractions, but on what those two people really are.", "Portions of these paragraphs are also quoted in Suzanne Bray, “‘The Exact Programme a Particular Country Wishes to Have’: C.S. Lewis’s Literary Broadcast for Iceland,” Sehnsucht, vol. 10 (2016), 21-32."]

No feeling of apology accompanied this note, left at Warnie’s hotel, because by now Jack took it for granted that Mrs Moore and her family took precedence over everything. He added insult to injury by saying ‘another time if possible you should warn me for duty earlier.’” Wilson himself attributes this quote to the Lewis Papers VI, 193.", "It’s possible that Wilson used other scraps of the Lewis Papers not published elsewhere.

The hero of that earlier work is now transported to a world of sweet smells and delicious tastes, where beasts are friendly and naked beauty is unashamed; a new Garden of Eden, wherein is enacted, but with a difference, the story of the Temptation. Mr. Lewis is convinced that ‘popular science’ is the actual mythology of our age, and he has endeavored to make that mythology the medium of spiritual imagination. His aim is partly to exorcise the evil and ugly fantasies which such material is already attracting to itself; but much more to find on his own account that ‘unimaginable lodge for solitary thinkings’ which Homer found in the Mediterranean, the medieval romancer in Babylon, and Samuel Butler in Australia, but for which we ourselves must now ransack space. Those readers who journeyed with Ransom to Malacandra will revel in this second voyage through the unknown, and in the strangeness both of beauty and horror which awaits the stranger.",
